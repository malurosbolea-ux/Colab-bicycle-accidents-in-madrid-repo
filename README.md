# 🚲 Bicycle Accidents Analysis — Madrid 2025  
**By María Luisa Ros Bolea**  
_Analysis date: November 2025_

A map of data, an urban rhythm, and a city that never stops pedaling.  
This project explores bicycle accidents that occurred in Madrid during 2025 to uncover patterns, risks, contexts, and potential pathways toward safer mobility.

---

## ✨ About the Project  
This analysis combines **descriptive statistics**, **visualizations**, **cross-tabulation analysis**, and a **predictive model** based on a Decision Tree Classifier.  
The goal: understand which factors influence accident severity and how patterns differ across age, gender, district, accident type, weather, alcohol/drug involvement, and more.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Identify the most frequent factors behind bicycle accidents in Madrid.  
- Detect patterns related to demographics, location, and environmental conditions.  
- Explore relationships between variables using visualizations and cross-tabs.  
- Test a predictive model to estimate injury severity.  
- Provide recommendations for mobility planning and accident prevention.

## 📁 Dataset  
**827 records** | **19 columns**

Includes:  
- Gender  
- Age range  
- District  
- Accident type  
- Weather conditions  
- Vehicle type  
- Injury severity  
- Alcohol/drug test results

## 🔍 Key Analyses

### 🔢 Descriptive Statistics  
- Most victims are **men**, especially young adults.  
- Most common accidents: **collisions** and **falls**.  
- Injuries are mostly **moderate**.  
- Central districts show the highest accident density.  
- Rain slightly increases accident probability.

### 📊 Visualizations  
Included charts:  
- Histograms and bar plots by gender, age, district, and accident type.  
- Heatmaps capturing correlations across key variables.  
- All plots exported using a consistent blue color palette.

### 🔥 Highlighted Cross-Tabs  
- Gender × Accident Type  
- Age × Injury Severity  
- District × Accident Type  
- Weather × Accident Type  
- Age × Alcohol/Drug test results

## 🤖 Predictive Model  
A **Decision Tree Classifier** was implemented to estimate injury severity.

**Results:**  
- *Accuracy:* ~38%  
- Effective for exploring structure, but limited predictive power due to class imbalance.  
- Serves as a foundation for future, more advanced models.

---

## 💡 Key Findings  
- Peak accident times occur during **commuting hours**.  
- Young cyclists experience more accidents; older cyclists experience more severe injuries.  
- Central districts are high-risk zones.  
- Weather affects accidents slightly, but is not a major driver.  
- Cross-tab heatmaps reveal strong correlations across demographic and geographic variables.

---

## 🧭 Recommendations  
- Develop awareness campaigns for **young male cyclists**.  
- Strengthen traffic safety measures in high-risk districts.  
- Encourage helmet and protective equipment use among older cyclists.  
- Use predictive insights to support urban planning for safer mobility.

## 🌱 Conclusion  
This project not only describes what happens—it reveals *why* it happens.  
Madrid moves, breathes, accelerates… and the data keeps the beat.  
A study built not just to measure, but to **guide transformation**.
